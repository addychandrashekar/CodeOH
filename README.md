   pip install --user fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy bcrypt psycopg2 pydantic

Note: Ensure that `pip` is correctly pointing to Python 3 before running the installation command. If unsure, use:
python3 -m pip install --user fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy bcrypt psycopg2 pydantic

2. To run the FastAPI server:
   uvicorn main:app --reload

Note: Ensure that `pip` is correctly pointing to Python 3 before running the installation command. If unsure, use:
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload

4. Then, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to test APIs using Swagger UI.

5. Database Connection
